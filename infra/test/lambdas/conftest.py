"""Shared fixtures for the infra Lambda handler tests.

Patch the boto3 factory to mock the cloudwatch client so it survives the in-test
`importlib.reload(index)` and never makes real PutMetricData calls.

Adding a test for another Lambda handler here
-----------------------------------------------
Every handler in this repo is named ``index.py``. Importing one by its bare
module name registers it as ``sys.modules["index"]``, so two such test modules
in this directory fight over that one slot: whichever imports last wins, and
``@patch("index.<attr>")`` in the other module then resolves against the wrong
handler and raises ``AttributeError`` — only when the files run together, which
makes it look like a flaky, order-dependent failure.

``test_vkg_reload_handler.py`` owns the bare ``index`` name (it patches
``index.ecs`` / ``index.sd`` / ``index.ssm`` in ~19 places). Any NEW handler test
must load its module under a unique name instead of touching ``sys.path`` — see
``test_lakeformation_admin_handler.py`` for the ``spec_from_file_location``
pattern.

# Every handler in this directory builds its boto3 clients at MODULE scope, so the
# clients are constructed the moment the test imports the handler — before any
# fixture can replace them. botocore resolves the region at construction, so on a
# machine with no region configured that import raises
# ``botocore.exceptions.NoRegionError`` and every test in the file ERRORS rather
# than fails. Set at import time (not in a fixture) so it lands before collection
# imports anything.
#
# ``setdefault``, not assignment: only the PRESENCE of a region matters here. The
# clients are replaced with mocks immediately after import and no request is ever
# signed or sent, so a developer with a different region exported is unaffected.
# (Contrast packages/sources/tests/unit/conftest.py, which must PIN the region
# because there an inherited value genuinely changes behaviour.)
