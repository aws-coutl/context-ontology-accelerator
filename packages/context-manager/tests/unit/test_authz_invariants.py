"""End-to-end security invariants: grant rows → resolved profile → firewall decision.

The per-unit suites (``test_role_resolver.py``, ``test_sql_firewall.py``) each cover
their own half. These tests exist because the halves can agree individually and
still compose into a bypass: the resolver can emit a restriction the firewall then
declines to enforce.

That is not hypothetical — it is how the empty-``tableAllowlist`` fail-open was
found. ``test_explicitly_empty_allowlist_denies_all_tables`` asserted the resolver
produced ``[]`` and passed, while the firewall treated the empty list as falsy,
dropped the restriction, and allowed every table. A profile-level assertion cannot
catch that; only running the query through can.

Each test therefore asserts on the DECISION (denied / allowed), never on an
intermediate field.
